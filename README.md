3. Populate .env file with bot token.
#### Bot token can be obtained from @BotFather.

4. Run ```node bot``` to start the bot.

#### It's advisable to run the bot using PM2 or any startup manager for persistent execution, as this ensures you won't have to have the terminal open. You can set up auto-start as well. Or pass a cron job.
